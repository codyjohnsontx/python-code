"""**Write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.**

-This was a fun one that felt good to finally get right. I was a little stumped trying to figure out best to count out each instance of the letters of 'true' and 'love' without writing a bunch of unreadable code
Another thing that got me for a little bit was concatenating the sum of 'true' and 'love' together IE 7 + 8 = 78 A little time, research and brainstorming later I was able to figure it out

Thanks for checking it out!
